# Update unsound DrainFilter and RString::retain

Affected versions of this crate contained code from the Rust standard library that contained soundness bugs rust-lang/rust#60977 (double drop) & rust-lang/rust#78498 (create invalid utf-8 string).

The flaw was corrected in v0.9.1 by making a similar fix to the one made in the Rust standard library.
