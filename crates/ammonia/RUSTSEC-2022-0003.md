# Space bug in `clean_text`

An incorrect mapping from HTML specification to ASCII codes was used.
Because HTML treats the Form Feed as whitespace, code like this has an injection bug:

    let html = format!("<div title={}>", clean_text(user_supplied_string));

Applications are not affected if they quote their attributes, or if they don't use `clean_text` at all.
