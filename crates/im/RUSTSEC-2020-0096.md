# TreeFocus lacks bounds on its Send and Sync traits

Affected versions of `im` contains `TreeFocus` that unconditionally implements `Send` and `Sync`.

This allows a data race in safe Rust code if `TreeFocus` is extracted from `Focus` type.
Typical users that only use `Focus` type are not affected.
