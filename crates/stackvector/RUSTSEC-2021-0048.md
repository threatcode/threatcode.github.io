# StackVec::extend can write out of bounds when size_hint is incorrect

`StackVec::extend` used the lower and upper bounds from an Iterator's
`size_hint` to determine how many items to push into the stack based vector.

If the `size_hint` implementation returned a lower bound that was larger than
the upper bound, `StackVec` would write out of bounds and overwrite memory
on the stack. As mentioned by the [size_hint](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#provided-methods)
documentation, `size_hint` is mainly for optimization and incorrect
implementations should not lead to memory safety issues.
