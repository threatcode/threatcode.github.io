# push_cloned can drop uninitialized memory or double free on panic

Affected versions of `stack_dst` used a `push_inner` function that increased
the internal length of the array and then called `val.clone()`.

If the `val.clone()` call panics, the stack could drop an already dropped
element or drop uninitialized memory.

This issue was fixed in `2a4d538` by increasing the length of the array after
elements are cloned.
