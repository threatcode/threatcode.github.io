The crate GitHub repository is now [wooorm/markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs)

# `markdown` (0.3.0 and lower) was unmaintained

The old [`markdown`](https://crates.io/crates/markdown) crate was no longer actively maintained.

The crate GitHub repository was [johannhof/markdown.rs](https://github.com/johannhof/markdown.rs)
