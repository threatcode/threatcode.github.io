# Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in deserialization

Affected versions of this crate did not properly check for recursion
while deserializing aliases.

This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with an alias referring
to itself causing an abort.

The flaw was corrected by checking the recursion depth.
