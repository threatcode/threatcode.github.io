# LateStatic has incorrect Sync bound

Affected versions of this crate implemented `Sync` for `LateStatic` with `T: Send`, so that it is possible to create a data race to a type `T: Send + !Sync` (e.g. `Cell<T>`).

This can result in a memory corruption or other kinds of undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected in commit 11f396c by replacing the `T: Send` bound to `T: Sync` bound in the `Sync` impl for `LateStatic<T>`.
