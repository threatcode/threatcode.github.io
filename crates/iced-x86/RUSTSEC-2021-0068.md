# Soundness issue in `iced-x86` versions <= 1.10.3 

Versions of iced-x86 <= 1.10.3 invoke undefined behavior which may cause soundness
issues in crates using the `iced_x86::Decoder` struct. The `Decoder::new()` function
made a call to `slice.get_unchecked(slice.length())` to get the end position of 
the input buffer. The flaw was fixed with safe logic that does not invoke undefined
behavior.
