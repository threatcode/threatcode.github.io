#  Invalid use of `mem::uninitialized` causes `use-of-uninitialized-value`

The compression and decompression function used `mem:uninitialized`
to create an array of uninitialized values, to later write values into it.
This later leads to reads from uninitialized memory.

The flaw was corrected in commit b633bf265e41c60dfce3be7eac4e4dd5e18d06cf
by using a heap-allocated `Vec` and removing out use of `mem::uninitialized`.
The fix was released in v0.3.2 and v1.0.0

Subsequently the crate was deprecated and its use is discouraged.
