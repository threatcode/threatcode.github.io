# Memory safety issues in `compact::Vec`

`compact::Vec` contains multiple memory safety issues.

1. It mishandles large capacity and causes out-of-bound access in 32-bit / allocator layout mismatch in 64-bit.
2. `remove()` is not panic-safe and causes double-free when an index larger than the length is provided.
