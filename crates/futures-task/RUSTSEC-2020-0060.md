# futures_task::waker may cause a use-after-free if used on a type that isn't 'static

Affected versions of the crate did not properly implement a `'static` lifetime bound on the `waker` function.
This resulted in a use-after-free if `Waker::wake()` is called after original data had been dropped.

The flaw was corrected by adding `'static` lifetime bound to the data `waker` takes.
