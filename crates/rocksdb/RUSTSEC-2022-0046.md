# Out-of-bounds read when opening multiple column families with TTL

Affected versions of this crate called the RocksDB C API
`rocksdb_open_column_families_with_ttl()` with a pointer to a single integer
TTL value, but one TTL value for each column family is expected.

This is only relevant when using
`rocksdb::DBWithThreadMode::open_cf_descriptors_with_ttl()` with multiple
column families.

This bug has been fixed in v0.19.0.
