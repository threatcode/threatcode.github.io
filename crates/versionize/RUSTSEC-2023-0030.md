# `Versionize::deserialize` implementation for `FamStructWrapper<T>` is lacking bound checks, potentially leading to out of bounds memory accesses 

An issue was discovered in the `Versionize::deserialize` implementation provided by the `versionize` crate for `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper`, which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The impact started with version 0.1.1. The issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise.
