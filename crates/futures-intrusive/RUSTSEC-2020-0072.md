# GenericMutexGuard allows data races of non-Sync types across threads

`GenericMutexGuard<T>` was given the `Sync` auto trait as long as `T` is `Send`
due to its contained members. However, since the guard is supposed to represent
an **acquired lock** and allows concurrent access to the underlying data from
different threads, it should only be `Sync` when the underlying data is.

This is a soundness issue and allows data races, potentially leading to crashes
and segfaults from safe Rust code.

The flaw was corrected by adding a `T: Send + Sync` bound for
`GenericMutexGuard`'s `Sync` trait.

This bug is [similar to one](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41622) in
`std::sync::Mutex`.
