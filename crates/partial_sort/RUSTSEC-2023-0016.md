# Possible out-of-bounds read in release mode

Affected versions of this crate were using a debug assertion to validate the
`last` parameter of `partial_sort()`. This would allow invalid inputs to cause
an out-of-bounds read instead of immediately panicking, when compiled without
debug assertions.

All writes are bounds-checked, so the out-of-bounds memory access is read-only.
This also means that the first attempted out-of-bounds write will panic,
limiting the possible reads.

The accessible region is further limited by an initial bounds-checked read
at `(last / 2) - 1`, i.e., it is proportional to the size of the vector.

This bug has been fixed in v0.2.0.
