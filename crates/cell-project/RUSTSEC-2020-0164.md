# `cell-project` used incorrect variance when projecting through `&Cell<T>`

## Overview

The issue lies in the implementation of the `cell_project` macro which used `field as *const _` instead of `field as *mut _`.
The problem being that `*const T` is covariant in `T` while `*mut T` is invariant in `T`. Keep in mind that `&Cell<T>` is invariant in `T`,
so casting to `*const T` relaxed the variance, and lead to unsoundness, as shown in the example below.

```rs
use std::cell::Cell;
use cell_project::cell_project as cp;

struct Foo<'a> {
    x: Option<&'a Cell<Foo<'a>>>,
}

impl<'a> Drop for Foo<'a> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // `ourselves` is an &Cell<Self>.
        // NB: `Drop` is unsound.
        if let Some(ourselves) = self.x.as_ref() {
            // replace `self` (but this doesn't actually replace `self`)
            let is_x_none = ourselves.replace(Foo {
                x: None,
            }).x.as_ref().is_none();
            // if we just moved out of `self`, and we had a `Some` originally,
            // how come this is a `None`?
            if is_x_none {
                println!("how did we get a None?");
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Cell::new(Foo {
        x: None,
    });
    let x = cp!(Foo<'_>, foo.x);
    x.set(Some(&foo));
}
```

## Affected Versions

All versions of the cell-project crate before `0.1.4` are affected.

## Mitigation

This was fixed in [Issues/4], and released as version `0.1.4`.
So just updating to the latest version will include the fix (which may result in a compile error on unsound usage).

## Acknowledgements

This was discovered and fixed by @SoniEx2 in cell-project: [Issues/3] and [Issues/4]
