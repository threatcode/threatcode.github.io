# Memory corruption in SmallVec::grow()

Attempting to call `grow` on a spilled SmallVec with a value less than the current capacity causes corruption of memory allocator data structures.

An attacker that controls the value passed to `grow` may exploit this flaw to obtain memory contents or gain remote code execution.

Credits to @ehuss for discovering, reporting and fixing the bug.
