# QueueSender<T>/QueueReceiver<T>: Send/Sync impls need `T: Send`

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send`/`Sync` for `QueueSender<T>`,
allowing to send non-Send `T` to other threads by invoking `(&QueueSender<T>).send()`.

This fails to prevent users from creating data races by sending types like `Rc<T>` or `Arc<Cell<T>>` to other threads, which can lead to memory corruption.

The flaw was corrected in commit 1e462c3 by imposing `T: Send` to both `Send`/`Sync` impls for `QueueSender<T>`/`QueueReceiver<T>`.
