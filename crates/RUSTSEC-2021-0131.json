  "summary": "Integer overflow in the bundled Brotli C library",
  "details": "A buffer overflow exists in the Brotli library versions prior to 1.0.8 where an attacker controlling the input length of a \"one-shot\" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB.\n\nAn updated version of `brotli-sys` has not been released. If one cannot update the C library, its authors recommend to use the \"streaming\" API as opposed to the \"one-shot\" API, and impose chunk size limits.\n\nIn Rust the issue can be mitigated by migrating to the `brotli` crate, which provides a Rust implementation of Brotli compression and decompression that is not affected by this issue.",
