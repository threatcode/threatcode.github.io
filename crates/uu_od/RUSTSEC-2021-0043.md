# PartialReader passes uninitialized memory to user-provided Read

Affected versions of this crate passed an uniniitalized buffer to a
user-provided `Read` instance in `PartialReader::read`.

This can result in safe `Read` implementations reading from the uninitialized
buffer leading to undefined behavior.

The flaw was fixed in commit [`39d62c6`](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/commit/39d62c6c1f809022c903180471c10fde6ecd12d1)
by zero-initializing the passed buffer.
