# Fix a use-after-free bug in diesels Sqlite backend

We've misused `sqlite3_column_name`. The
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_name.html) documentation
states that the following:

> The returned string pointer is valid until either the prepared statement
> is destroyed by sqlite3_finalize() or until the statement is automatically
> reprepared by the first call to sqlite3_step() for a particular
> run or until the next call to sqlite3_column_name()
> or sqlite3_column_name16() on the same column.

As part of our `query_by_name` infrastructure we've first received all
field names for the prepared statement and stored them as string slices
for later use. After that we called `sqlite3_step()` for the first time,
which invalids the pointer and therefore the stored string slice.
