# AtomicBucket<T> unconditionally implements Send/Sync

In the affected versions of the crate, `AtomicBucket<T>` unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` traits. Therefore, users can create a data race to the inner
`T: !Sync` by using the `AtomicBucket::data_with()` API.
Such data races can potentially cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.

The flaw was fixed in commit 8e6daab by adding appropriate Send/Sync bounds to the Send/Sync impl of struct `Block<T>` (which is a data type contained inside `AtomicBucket<T>`).
