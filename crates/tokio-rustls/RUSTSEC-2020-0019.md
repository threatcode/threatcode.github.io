# tokio-rustls reads may cause excessive memory usage

`tokio-rustls` does not call `process_new_packets` immediately after `read`,
so the expected termination condition `wants_read` always returns true.
As long as new incoming data arrives faster than it is processed
and the reader does not return pending, data will be buffered.

This may cause DoS.
