# Invalid pointer dereference in `d2i_PKCS7` functions

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the
`d2i_PKCS7()`, `d2i_PKCS7_bio()` or `d2i_PKCS7_fp()` functions.

The result of the dereference is an application crash which could
lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL
does not call this function however third party applications might
call these functions on untrusted data.
