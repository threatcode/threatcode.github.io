# Flaw in streaming state reset() functions can create incorrect results.

Affected versions of this crate did not properly reset a streaming state.

Resetting a streaming state, without finalising it first, creates incorrect results.
 
The flaw was corrected by not first checking if the state had already been reset, when calling reset().
