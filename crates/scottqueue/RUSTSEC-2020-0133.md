# Queue<T> should have a Send bound on its Send/Sync traits

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` for `Queue<T>`.

This allows (1) creating data races to a `T: !Sync` and (2) sending `T: !Send` to other threads, resulting in memory corruption or other undefined behavior.
