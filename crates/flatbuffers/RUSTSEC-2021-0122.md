# Generated code can read and write out of bounds in safe code

Code generated by flatbuffers' compiler is `unsafe` but not marked as such.
See https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/6627 for details.

For example, if generated code is used to decode malformed or untrusted input,
undefined behavior (and thus security vulnerabilities) is possible even without
the use of the `unsafe` keyword, [violating the the meaning of "safe"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.unsafe.html#the-different-meanings-of-unsafe) code;

All users that use generated code by `flatbuffers` compiler are recommended to:
1. not expose flatbuffer generated code as part of their public APIs
2. audit their code and look for any usage of `follow`, `push`, or any method that uses them
   (e.g. `self_follow`).
3. Carefuly go through the crates' documentation to understand which "safe" APIs are not
   intended to be used.
