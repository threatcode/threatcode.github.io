# Cache<K>: Send/Sync impls needs trait bounds on `K`

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `Cache<K>`.
This allows users to insert `K` that is not Send or not Sync.

This allows users to create data races by using non-Send types like `Arc<Cell<T>>` or `Rc<T>` as `K` in `Cache<K>`. It is also possible to create data races by using types like `Cell<T>` or `RefCell<T>` (types that are `Send` but not `Sync`).
Such data races can lead to memory corruption.
