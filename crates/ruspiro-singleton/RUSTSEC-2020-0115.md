# Singleton lacks bounds on Send and Sync.

`Singleton<T>` is meant to be a static object that can be initialized lazily. In
order to satisfy the requirement that `static` items must implement `Sync`,
`Singleton` implemented both `Sync` and `Send` unconditionally.

This allows for a bug where non-`Sync` types such as `Cell` can be used in
singletons and cause data races in concurrent programs.

The flaw was corrected in commit `b0d2bd20e` by adding trait bounds, requiring
the contaiend type to implement `Sync`.
