# Use after free in MacOS / iOS implementation

In iana-time-zone v0.1.43 a use-after-free bug in the MacOS / iOS implementation was introduced.

The copied system time zone was released before its name was copied.
If the system time zone was changed between the call of `CFRelease` and `str::to_owned()`,
random memory would be copied.
