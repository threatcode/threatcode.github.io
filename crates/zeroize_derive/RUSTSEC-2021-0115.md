# `#[zeroize(drop)]` doesn't implement `Drop` for `enum`s

Affected versions of this crate did not implement `Drop` when `#[zeroize(drop)]` was used on an `enum`.

This can result in memory not being zeroed out after dropping it, which is exactly what is intended when adding this attribute.

The flaw was corrected in version 1.2 and `#[zeroize(drop)]` on `enum`s now properly implements `Drop`.
