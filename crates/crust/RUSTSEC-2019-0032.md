# crust repo has been archived; use libp2p instead

** The `crust` crate repo was archived with no warning or explanation.**

Given that it was archived with no warning or successor, there's not an
official replacement but [`rust-libp2p`](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p)
looks like it's got a similar feature set and is actively maintained.
