# Flaw in generativity allows out-of-bounds access

Affected versions of this crate did not properly implement the generativity,
because the invariant lifetimes were not necessarily `drop`ped.

This allows an attacker to mix up two arenas, using indices created from one
arena with another one. This might lead to an out-of-bounds read or write
access into the memory reserved for the arena.

The flaw was corrected by implementing generativity correctly in version 0.4.0.
