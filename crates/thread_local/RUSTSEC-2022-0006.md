# Data race in `Iter` and `IterMut`

In the affected version of this crate, `{Iter, IterMut}::next` used a weaker memory ordering when loading values than what was required, exposing a potential data race
when iterating over a `ThreadLocal`'s values.

Crates using `Iter::next`, or `IterMut::next` are affected by this issue.
