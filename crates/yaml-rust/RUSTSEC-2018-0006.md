# Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in deserialization

Affected versions of this crate did not prevent deep recursion while
deserializing data structures.

This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with deeply nested structures
that causes an abort while deserializing it.

The flaw was corrected by checking the recursion depth.

Note: `clap 2.33` is not affected by this because it uses `yaml-rust`
in a way that doesn't trigger the vulnerability. More specifically:

1. The input to the YAML parser is always trusted - is included at compile
time via `include_str!`.

2. The nesting level is never deep enough to trigger the overflow in practice
(at most 5).
