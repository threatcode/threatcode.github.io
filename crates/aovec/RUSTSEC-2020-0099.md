# Aovec<T> lacks bound on its Send and Sync traits allowing data races

`aovec::Aovec<T>` is a vector type that implements `Send` and `Sync` for all
types `T`.

This allows non-Send types such as `Rc` and non-Sync types such as `Cell` to
be used across thread boundaries which can trigger undefined behavior and
memory corruption.
