# Soundness issue: Input<R> can be misused to create data race to an object

`Input<R>` implements `Send` without requiring `R: Send`.

Affected versions of this crate allows users to send non-Send types to other threads,
which can lead to undefined behavior such as data race and memory corruption.

The flaw was corrected in version 0.5.1 by adding `R: Send` bound to the `Send` impl of `Input<R>`.
