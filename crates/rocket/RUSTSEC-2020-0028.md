# `LocalRequest::clone` creates multiple mutable references to the same object

The affected version of `rocket` contains a `Clone` trait implementation of
`LocalRequest` that reuses the pointer to inner `Request` object.
This causes data race in rare combinations of APIs if the original and the
cloned objects are modified at the same time.
