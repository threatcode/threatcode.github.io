# Task dropped in wrong thread when aborting `LocalSet` task

When aborting a task with `JoinHandle::abort`, the future is dropped in the
thread calling abort if the task is not currently being executed. This is
incorrect for tasks spawned on a `LocalSet`.

This can easily result in race conditions as many projects use `Rc` or `RefCell`
in their Tokio tasks for better performance.

See [tokio#3929][issue] for more details.
