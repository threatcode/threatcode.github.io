# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Wasmtime

* [Use after free passing `externref`s to Wasm in
  Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-v4cp-h94r-m7xf)

* [Out-of-bounds read/write and invalid free with `externref`s and GC safepoints
  in
  Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-4873-36h9-wv49)

* [Wrong type for `Linker`-define functions when used across two
  `Engine`s](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx)
