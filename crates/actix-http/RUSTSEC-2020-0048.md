# Use-after-free in BodyStream due to lack of pinning

Affected versions of this crate did not require the buffer wrapped in `BodyStream` to be pinned,
but treated it as if it had a fixed location in memory. This may result in a use-after-free.
 
The flaw was corrected by making the trait `MessageBody` require `Unpin`
and making `poll_next()` function accept `Pin<&mut Self>` instead of `&mut self`.
