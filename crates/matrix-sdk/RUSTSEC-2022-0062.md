# matrix-sdk 0.6.0 logs access tokens

When sending Matrix requests using an affected version of `matrix-sdk` in an application that
writes logs using `tracing-subscriber` (in a way that includes fields of tracing spans such as
`tracing_subscriber`s default text output from the `fmt` module), these logs will contain the
user's access token.
