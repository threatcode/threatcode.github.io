# Improper Synchronization and Race Condition in vm-memory

rust-vmm vm-memory before 0.1.1 and 0.2.x before 0.2.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (loss of IP networking) because read_obj and write_obj do not properly access memory. This affects aarch64 (with musl or glibc) and x86_64 (with musl).
