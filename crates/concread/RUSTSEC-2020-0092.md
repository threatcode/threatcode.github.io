# Send/Sync bound needed on V in `impl Send/Sync for ARCache<K, V>`

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send`/`Sync` traits for `ARCache<K, V>` type.

This allows users to send/access types that do not implement `Send`/`Sync`, which can cause a data race.

The flaw was corrected in the 0.2.6 release by adding bounds `K: Send + Sync` & `V: Send + Sync` to affected `Send`/`Sync` trait implementations.
