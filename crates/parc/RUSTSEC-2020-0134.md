# `LockWeak<T>` allows to create data race to `T`.

In the affected versions of this crate, `LockWeak<T>` unconditionally implemented `Send` with no trait bounds on `T`. `LockWeak<T>` doesn't own `T` and only provides `&T`.

This allows concurrent access to a non-Sync `T`, which can cause undefined behavior like data races.
