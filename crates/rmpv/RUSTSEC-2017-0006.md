# Unchecked vector pre-allocation

Affected versions of this crate pre-allocate memory on deserializing raw
buffers without checking whether there is sufficient data available.

This allows an attacker to do denial-of-service attacks by sending small
msgpack messages that allocate gigabytes of memory.
