# Flaw in Scalar::check_overflow allows side-channel timing attack

Versions of `libsecp256k1` prior to `0.3.1` did not execute
Scalar::check_overflow in constant time.

This allows an attacker to potentially leak information via a timing attack.

The flaw was corrected by modifying Scalar::check_overflow to execute in
constant time.
