  "details": "Affected versions of the crate have a bug where attacker-controlled\ninput can result in the use of an out-of-bound array index.  Rust\ndetects the use of the out-of-bound index and causes the application\nto panic.  An attacker may be able to use this to cause a\ndenial-of-service.  However, it is not possible for an attacker to\nread from or write to the application's address space.",
