# Multiple soundness issues in `owning_ref`

- `OwningRef::map_with_owner` is [unsound](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs/issues/77) and may result in a use-after-free.
- `OwningRef::map` is [unsound](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs/issues/71) and may result in a use-after-free.
- `OwningRefMut::as_owner` and `OwningRefMut::as_owner_mut` are [unsound](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs/issues/61) and may result in a use-after-free.
- The crate [violates Rust's aliasing rules](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs/issues/49), which may cause miscompilations on recent compilers that emit the LLVM `noalias` attribute.

No patched versions are available at this time. While a pull request with some fixes is outstanding, the maintainer appears to be unresponsive.
