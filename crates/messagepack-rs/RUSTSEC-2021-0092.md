# Deserialization functions pass uninitialized memory to user-provided Read

Affected versions of this crate passed an uninitialized buffer to a
user-provided `Read` instance in:

* `deserialize_binary`
* `deserialize_string`
* `deserialize_extension_others`
* `deserialize_string_primitive`

This can result in safe `Read` implementations reading from the uninitialized
buffer leading to undefined behavior.
