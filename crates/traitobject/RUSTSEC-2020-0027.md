# traitobject assumes the layout of fat pointers

This crate gets the data pointer from fat pointers assuming that the first
element in a fat pointer is the data pointer. This is currently true, but
it may change in a future Rust version, leading to memory corruption.

This has been fixed in the master branch of the crate, but is has not
been released into crates.io.
