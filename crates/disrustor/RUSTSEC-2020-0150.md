# RingBuffer can create multiple mutable references and cause data races

The `RingBuffer` type retrieves mutable references from the `DataProvider` in a
non-atomic manner, potentially allowing the creation of multiple mutable
references. `RingBuffer` also implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all
types `T`.

This allows undefined behavior from the aliased mutable references as well
as data races.
