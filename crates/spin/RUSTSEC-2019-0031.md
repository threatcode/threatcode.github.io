# spin is no longer actively maintained

The author of the `spin` crate does not have time or interest to maintain it.

Consider the following alternatives (all of which support `no_std`):

- [`conquer-once`](https://github.com/oliver-giersch/conquer-once)
- [`lock_api`](https://crates.io/crates/lock_api) (a subproject of `parking_lot`)
  - [`spinning_top`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top) spinlock crate built on `lock_api`
- [`spinning`](https://github.com/4lDO2/spinning-rs)
