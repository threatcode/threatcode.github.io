# MsQueue and SegQueue suffer from double-free

Even if an element is popped from a queue, crossbeam would run its
destructor inside the epoch-based garbage collector. This is a source
of double frees.

The flaw was corrected by wrapping elements inside queues in a
`ManuallyDrop`.

Thanks to @c0gent for reporting the issue.
