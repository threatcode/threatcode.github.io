# `SegQueue` creates zero value of any type

Affected versions of this crate called `mem::zeroed()` to create values of a user-supplied type `T`.
This is unsound e.g. if `T` is a reference type (which must be non-null).
 
The flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::zeroed()`, using `MaybeUninit` instead.
