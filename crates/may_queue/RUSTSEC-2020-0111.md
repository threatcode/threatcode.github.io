# may_queue's Queue lacks Send/Sync bound for its Send/Sync trait.

Affected versions of `may_queue` implements `Send`/`Sync` for its `Queue` type without restricting it to `Send`able types and `Sync`able types.

This allows non-`Sync` types such as `Cell` to be shared across threads leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption in concurrent programs.
