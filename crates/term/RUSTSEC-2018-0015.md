# term is looking for a new maintainer

The author of the `term` crate does not have time to maintain it and is looking
for a new maintainer.

Some maintained alternatives you can potentially switch to instead, depending
on your needs:

- [`crossterm`](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm)
- [`termcolor`](https://crates.io/crates/termcolor)
- [`yansi`](https://crates.io/crates/yansi)
