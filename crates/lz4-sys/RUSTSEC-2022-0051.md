# Memory corruption in liblz4

lz4-sys up to v1.9.3 bundles a version of liblz4 that is vulnerable to
[CVE-2021-3520](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3520).

Attackers could craft a payload that triggers an integer overflow upon
decompression, causing an out-of-bounds write.

The flaw has been corrected in version v1.9.4 of liblz4, which is included
in lz4-sys 1.9.4.
