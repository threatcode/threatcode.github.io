# HMAC-BLAKE2 algorithms compute incorrect results

When used in conjunction with the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC),
the BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s implementations in `blake2` crate versions prior to
v0.8.1 used an incorrect block size (32-bytes instead of 64-bytes for BLAKE2s,
and 64-bytes instead of 128-bytes for BLAKE2b), causing them to miscompute the
`MacResult`.

The v0.8.1 release of the `blake2` crate uses the correct block sizes.

Note that this advisory only impacts usage of BLAKE2 with HMAC, and does not
impact `Digest` functionality.
