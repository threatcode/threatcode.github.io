# KeyValueReader passes uninitialized memory to Read instance

The `KeyValueReader` type in affected versions of this crate set up an
uninitialized memory buffer and passed them to be read in to a user-provided
`Read` instance.

The `Read` instance could read uninitialized memory and cause undefined
behavior and miscompilations.

This issue was fixed in commit [dd59b30](https://github.com/SolraBizna/outer_cgi/commit/dd59b3066e616a08e756f72de8dc3ab11b7036c4)
by zero-initializing the buffers before passing them.
