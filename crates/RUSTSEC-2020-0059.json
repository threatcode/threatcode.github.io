  "summary": "MutexGuard::map can cause a data race in safe code",
  "details": "Affected versions of the crate had a Send/Sync implementation for MappedMutexGuard that only considered variance on T, while MappedMutexGuard dereferenced to U.\n\nThis could of led to data races in safe Rust code when a closure used in MutexGuard::map() returns U that is unrelated to T.\n\nThe issue was fixed by fixing `Send` and `Sync` implementations, and by adding a `PhantomData<&'a mut U>` marker to the `MappedMutexGuard` type to tell the compiler that the guard is over\nU too.",
