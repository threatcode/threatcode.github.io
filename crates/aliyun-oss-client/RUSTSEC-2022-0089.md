# `aliyun-oss-client` secret exposure

The `aliyun-oss-client` unintentionally divulges the authentication secret.

This bug was fixed in [this](https://github.com/tu6ge/oss-rs/commit/e4553f7d74fce682d802f8fb073943387796df29) commit by limiting the concerned traits to be `pub` only within the crate.
