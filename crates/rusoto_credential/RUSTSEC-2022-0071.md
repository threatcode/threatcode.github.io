# Rusoto is unmaintained

The maintainers of Rusoto advise that all its crates are deprecated. This includes the common crates `rusoto_core`, `rusoto_signature`, `rusoto_credential`, and service crates such as `rusoto_s3` and `rusoto_ec2`.

Users should migrate to the [AWS SDK for Rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust), which is maintained by AWS.
