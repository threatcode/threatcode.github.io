# Dangling reference in `access::Map` with Constant

Using the `arc_swap::access::Map` with the `Constant` test helper (or with
user-provided implementation of the `Access` trait) could sometimes lead to the
map returning dangling references.

Replaced by implementation without `unsafe`, at the cost of added `Clone` bound
on the closure and small penalty on performance.
