# Double drop upon panic in 'fn map_array()'

Affected versions of this crate did not guard against panic within the user-provided function `f` (2nd parameter of `fn map_array`), and thus panic within `f` 
causes double drop of a single object.

The flaw was corrected in the 0.4.0 release by wrapping the object vulnerable
to a double drop within `ManuallyDrop<T>`.
