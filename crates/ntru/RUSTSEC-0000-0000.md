# Unsound FFI: Wrong API usage causes write past allocated area

The following usage causes undefined behavior.
```rust
let kp: ntru::types::KeyPair = â€¦;
kp.get_public().export(Default::default())
```

When compiled with debug assertions, the code above will trigger a `attempt to subtract with overflow` panic before UB occurs.
Other mistakes (e.g. using `EncParams` from a different key) may always trigger UB.

Likely, older versions of this crate are also affected, but have not been tested.
