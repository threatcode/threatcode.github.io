# mozjpeg DecompressScanlines::read_scanlines is Unsound

This issue and vector is similar to [RUSTSEC-2020-0029] of `rgb` crate which `mozjpeg` depends on.

Affected versions of `mozjpeg` crate allow creating instances of any type `T` from bytes,
and do not correctly constrain `T` to the types for which it is safe to do so.

Examples of safety violation possible for a type `T`:

* `T` contains a reference type, and it constructs a pointer to an invalid, arbitrary memory address.
* `T` requires a safety and/or validity invariant for its construction that may be violated.

The issue was fixed in 0.8.19 by using safer types and involving `rgb` dependency bump.
