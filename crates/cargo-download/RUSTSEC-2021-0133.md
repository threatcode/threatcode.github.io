# cargo-download is unmaintained

The cargo download subcommand (via cargo-download crate) is broken and maintainer has disappeared from GitHub and hasn't had any commits for a year. 

Using this downloader will result to corrupted crates.

Maintainer has not responded to maintenance takeover.

Just use wget / curl directly.
