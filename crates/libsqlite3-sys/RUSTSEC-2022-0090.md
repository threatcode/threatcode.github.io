# `libsqlite3-sys` via C SQLite CVE-2022-35737

It was sometimes possible for SQLite versions >= 1.0.12, < 3.39.2 to allow an array-bounds overflow when large string were input into SQLite's `printf` function.

As `libsqlite3-sys` bundles SQLite, it is susceptible to the vulnerability. `libsqlite3-sys` was updated to bundle the patched version of SQLite [here](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/releases/tag/sys0.25.1).
