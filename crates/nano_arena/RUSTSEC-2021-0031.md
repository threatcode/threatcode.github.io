# split_at allows obtaining multiple mutable references to the same data

Affected versions of this crate assumed that `Borrow<Idx>` was guaranteed to
return the same value on `.borrow()`. The borrowed index value was used to
retrieve a mutable reference to a value.

If the `Borrow<Idx>` implementation returned a different index, the split arena
would allow retrieving the index as a mutable reference creating two mutable
references to the same element. This violates Rust's aliasing rules and allows
for memory safety issues such as writing out of bounds and use-after-frees.

The flaw was corrected in commit `6b83f9d` by storing the `.borrow()` value in
a temporary variable.
