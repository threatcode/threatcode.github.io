# Parser creates invalid uninitialized value

Affected versions of this crate called `mem::uninitialized()` in the HTTP1 parser to create values of type `httparse::Header` (from the `httparse` crate).
This is unsound, since `Header` contains references and thus must be non-null.
 
The flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::uninitialized()`, using `MaybeUninit` instead.
