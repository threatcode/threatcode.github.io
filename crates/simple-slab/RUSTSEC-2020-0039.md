# `index()` allows out-of-bound read and `remove()` has off-by-one error

`Slab::index()` does not perform the boundary checking, which leads to out-of-bound read access. `Slab::remove()` copies an element from an invalid address due to off-by-one error, resulting in memory leakage and uninitialized memory drop.
