# ReaderResult should be bounded by Sync

Affected versions of this crate implements `Sync` for `ReaderResult<T, E>` with the trait bound `T: Send, E: Send`.

Since matching on the public enum `ReaderResult<T, E>` provides access to `&T` & `&E`,
allowing data race to a non-Sync type `T` or `E`.
This can result in a memory corruption when multiple threads concurrently access `&T` or `&E`.

Suggested fix for the bug is change the trait bounds imposed on `T` & `E` to be `T: Sync, E: Sync`.
