# `openssl` `SubjectAlternativeName` and `ExtendedKeyUsage::other` allow arbitrary file read

`SubjectAlternativeName` and `ExtendedKeyUsage` arguments were parsed using the OpenSSL
function `X509V3_EXT_nconf`. This function parses all input using an OpenSSL mini-language
which can perform arbitrary file reads.

Thanks to David Benjamin (Google) for reporting this issue.
