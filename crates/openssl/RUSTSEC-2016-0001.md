# SSL/TLS MitM vulnerability due to insecure defaults

All versions of rust-openssl prior to 0.9.0 contained numerous insecure defaults
including off-by-default certificate verification and no API to perform hostname
verification.

Unless configured correctly by a developer, these defaults could allow an attacker
to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.

The problem was addressed in newer versions by enabling certificate verification
by default and exposing APIs to perform hostname verification. Use the
`SslConnector` and `SslAcceptor` types to take advantage of these new features
(as opposed to the lower-level `SslContext` type).
