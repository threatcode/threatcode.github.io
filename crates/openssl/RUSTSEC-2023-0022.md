# `openssl` `X509NameBuilder::build` returned object is not thread safe

OpenSSL has a `modified` bit that it can set on on `X509_NAME` objects. If this
bit is set then the object is not thread-safe even when it appears the code is
not modifying the value.

Thanks to David Benjamin (Google) for reporting this issue.
