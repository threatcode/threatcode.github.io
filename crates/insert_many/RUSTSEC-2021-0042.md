# insert_many can drop elements twice on panic

Affected versions of `insert_many` used `ptr::copy` to move over items in a
vector to make space before inserting, duplicating their ownership. It then
iterated over a provided `Iterator` to insert the new items.

If the iterator's `.next()` method panics then the vector would drop the same
elements twice.
