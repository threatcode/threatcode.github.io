# Soundness issue with base::Error

`base::Error` type contains public field named `ptr`.
With this definition, it is possible to create a `base::Error` with an invalid pointer and trigger memory safety errors
such as use-after-free or double-free with safe Rust.

The users of `xcb` crate are advised not to manipulate the field.
