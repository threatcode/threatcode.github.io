# quickersort is deprecated and unmaintained

The author of the `quickersort` crate has deprecated it and does not recommend using it anymore.

Everything in it has been incorporated into [std::sort_unstable] in the standard library as of Rust 1.20.

[std::sort_unstable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_unstable
