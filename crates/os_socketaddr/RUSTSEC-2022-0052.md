# `os_socketaddr` invalidly assumes the memory layout of std::net::SocketAddr

The [`os_socketaddr`](https://crates.io/crates/os_socketaddr) crate has assumed
`std::net::SocketAddrV4` and `std::net::SocketAddrV6` have the same memory layout as the system C
representation `sockaddr`. It has simply casted the pointers to convert the socket addresses to the
system representation.

These layout were [changed into idiomatic rust types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78802)
in nightly `std`. Starting from rustc 1.64 the affected versions of this crate will have undefined
behaviour.
