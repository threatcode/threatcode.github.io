# `through` and `through_and` causes a double free if the map function panics

`through` and `through_and` take a mutable reference as well as a mapping
function to change the provided reference. They do this by calling `ptr::read`
on the reference which duplicates ownership and then calling the mapping
function.

If the mapping function panics, both the original object and the one
duplicated by `ptr::read` get dropped, causing a double free.
