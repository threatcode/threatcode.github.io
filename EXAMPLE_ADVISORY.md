# RustSec Advisory Template - Advisory Title Goes Here

This is an example template for a RustSec advisory. Please copy this to
`crates/<crate-name>` and rename it to `RUSTSEC-0000-0000.md`.

In this section of the advisory you can write an extended description
of the vulnerability, will be converted into HTML and rendered at
<https://rustsec.org>.

- Markdown formatted
- TOML "front matter". See `README.md` for schema.
- Please include as much detail as you'd like.

A well structured advisory will include information like:

Affected versions of this crate did not properly check for integer overflow when allocating a buffer in `MyBuffer::with_capacity()` (bug description/location/root cause).

This can result in a memory corruption (consequence of the bug) when large integer is given to the parameter (trigger condition).

The flaw was corrected in commit abc123 by using `saturating_mul()` when calculating the buffer size (fix description).
