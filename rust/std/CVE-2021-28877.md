# TrustedRandomAaccess specialization composes incorrectly for nested iter::Zips

In the standard library in Rust before 1.51.0, the Zip implementation calls __iterator_get_unchecked() for the same index more than once when nested. This bug can lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.
