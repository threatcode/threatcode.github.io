id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23491
details: Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness
  of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Certifi 2022.12.07
  removes root certificates from "TrustCor" from the root store. These are in the
  process of being removed from Mozilla's trust store. TrustCor's root certificates
  are being removed pursuant to an investigation prompted by media reporting that
  TrustCor's ownership also operated a business that produced spyware. Conclusions
  of Mozilla's investigation can be found in the linked google group discussion.
